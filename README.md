# PINGBACK_JS
##Javascript to ping back to parent window from child window
###Details
This Javascript snippet is for the parent window to open a child popup window and the child window will return 
the results to the parent windows after processing. This kind of process is follwed when we have to check login of 
particular website say A using A's plugin on third party website B.
B will call a popup to check for the login and then the child window checks the login and return the result to the parent.
Its same as facebook authentication.
